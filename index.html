        <h1>Let's help Those <br> who Are More In Need</h1>
        <p>Today, 690 million people around the world will go to bed on an empty stomach. But your gift means that one less child will be at risk of starvation tonight.

Whether you decide to make a one-off donation or set up a monthly gift, you can change a life forever today. Often, one meal at the right time will be enough to make a difference between life and death. </p>

            <p>As soon as you complete your donation, your gift will start its journey. First your money will be turned into food, and then sent to one of the over 80 countries where people are most vulnerable. Every single day, WFP has 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and nearly 100 planes ready to deliver the food you send. Because you can't go there and hand out the food yourself, we do it for you. </p>

       <p>Blood brings oxygen and nutrients to all the parts of the body so they can keep working. Blood carries carbon dioxide and other waste materials to the lungs, kidneys, and digestive system to be removed from the body. Blood also fights infections, and carries hormones around the body.</p>

       <p>
        Parents with children are a growing segment of the U.S. homeless population. Sources indicate that homeless shelter dormitory bedrooms are highly crowded with low privacy, which may affect quality of experience that lead to residents' perceived loss of control and helplessness.
